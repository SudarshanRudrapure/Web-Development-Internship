1. Internet and the world wide web
---> The internet consists of multiple computers over a network that communicate with one another using a specific set of rules. The internet orginated from ARPANET.   
--->The internet of things(IOT)
    A subsets of the internet that includes computers and sensors connected to each other for communication and automatic transaction processing.
    also discussed Characteristics of IOT.

2. Networking
-->Packet-switched networks
	In a packet switched network, files are broken down into smaller pieces called packets, that are labelled electronically with their origins, sequences and destination address.
--->and also discussed Common network types like LAN(local area network),WAN(wide area network)
    public and private networks and virtual private networks(VPNs) and advantages of using VPN.
--->Intranet(Does not extend beyond the organization that created it) and
    Extranets(Much like intranet, but also extended to entities outside the boundaries of an organization such as business partners, customers and suppliers).

3. Web Server Basics
--->A web server is a computer that hosts web content or files that make up structure of websites.(includes things  such as images and so on) 
--->Responds to client requests by:
	*Transferring files and scripts to the web client(browser).
	*Generating a response by invoking scripts and querying a database.
--->Also know about the Web Client and Web Server
	*Web client (chrome, edge....)
	*A web client is the thing you use to access websites(in simple The client asks for information)->Client = requester + viewer
	*Web server(it hosts all the scripts and all the files that we need) 
	*A web server is a powerful computer (or group of computers) that stores websites and sends them to clients(In simple words The server answers the request).->Client asks → Server processes → Server replies → Client displays.
--->And also know about the how message flows in a two-tier client/server architecture and      three-tier client/server architecture.
--->also studied client-side scripting and server-side scripting.
	*client-side scripting
		->script is run by the client software(browser).
		->code instructs the client to request the script from server.
		->processing occurs on local machine(the users device).
		->Scripting languages included HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
	*server-side scripting
		->Script is run by the server software(backend).
		->server responds to the clients request.
		->server response is shaped based on client request.
		->Ideal for hosting a database.
		->Scripting languages include PHP, NodeJS, Python.

PLATFORM NEUTRALITY
	*The ability of a network to connect devices that use different operating systems is called platoform neutrality.
