## HTTP Request
**HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol
An HTTP request is a message sent by a client (like a web browser or mobile app) to a server asking it to do something—usually to get, send, or update data.

Simple example 
When you type www.google.com and press Enter, your browser sends an HTTP request to Google’s server saying:
“Please send me the Google homepage.”

Main parts of an HTTP request
1. Request Method – what action you want
GET → get data
POST → send data
PUT → update data
DELETE → delete data

URL – where the request is sent
Example: /login, /products
Headers – extra information
Example: browser type, content type
Body (optional) – data you send
Example: username & password in a login form

Very simple real-life analogy 
You (browser) = customer
Restaurant (server)
Menu order = HTTP request
Food = HTTP response

[ Browser / App ]
        |
        |  HTTP Request (GET / POST)
        ↓
[     Server     ]
        |
        |  HTTP Response (Data / HTML / JSON)
        ↓
[ Browser / App ]

-->Browser asks something → Server replies with data.

In One Line.....,
-->HTTP request = a way for frontend (browser) to talk to backend (server).
